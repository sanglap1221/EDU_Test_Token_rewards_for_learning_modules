# Token Rewards for Learning Modules

## Project Title
Token Rewards for Learning Modules

## Project Description
A blockchain-based system that rewards users with tokens upon completing learning modules. The smart contract ensures fair distribution of tokens, preventing duplicate rewards for the same module.

## Project Vision
This project aims to revolutionize online learning by incentivizing learners with token-based rewards. It encourages engagement and completion of educational content while leveraging blockchain technology for transparency and security.

## Future Scope
- Integration with a decentralized learning platform.
- Expanding the system to include multiple types of learning modules.
- Implementing a staking mechanism for unused tokens.
- Adding NFT certificates upon module completion.

## Key Features
- Smart contract-based token distribution.
- Ensures users receive rewards only once per completed module.
- Transparent and immutable reward tracking.
- Secure token storage and retrieval.
- Owner-controlled module completion verification.
